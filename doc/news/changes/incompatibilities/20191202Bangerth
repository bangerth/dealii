Removed: The include files in `include/deal.II/base/std_cxx1x`,
deprecated since 2014, have been removed. They had introduced a
namespace `std_cxx1x` at a time when deal.II did not yet require
C++11-compatible compilers, and this namespace was later also made
available via the name `std_cxx11` once C++11 was actually
published. In any case, none of this is necessary any more since we
now have C++11 compilers.
